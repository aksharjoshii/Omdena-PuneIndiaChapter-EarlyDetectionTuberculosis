# Omdena-PuneIndiaChapter-EarlyDetectionTuberculosis

## Project Overview

This repository houses the code, documentation, and resources for the **Early Detection of Tuberculosis** project undertaken by the **Omdena Pune India Chapter**. Our aim is to develop and deploy a mobile application that leverages deep learning for accurate and efficient TB screening in resource-limited rural settings.

## Background and Problem

Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major public health challenge in India, especially in rural areas. Limited access to healthcare, a shortage of trained radiologists, and inconsistent X-ray image quality often result in delayed diagnosis, impeding timely treatment. This project tackles key issues including:

- **Diagnostic Gaps**: Lack of accessible and accurate TB screening methods in rural regions.
- **Resource Constraints**: Shortage of trained radiologists to interpret chest X-rays.
- **Inconsistent Imaging Quality**: Variable X-ray quality due to equipment and operator limitations.
- **Scalability Challenges**: Difficulty in scaling traditional screening methods for broad population coverage.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Ensuring compatibility with existing healthcare infrastructure.

## Project Goals

1. **Develop a Deep Learning Model**: Build and train a TB detection model with high sensitivity and specificity using a diverse set of chest X-rays.
2. **Mobile Application Development**: Create a mobile app capable of running the TB detection model offline on smartphones and tablets.
3. **Deployment and Impact**: Deploy the mobile app across 50 rural health centers in three Indian states, with the goal of reducing TB diagnosis time by 50% within one year.

## Getting Started

This repository provides the following resources:

- **Codebase**: Folder containing scripts for model training and application deployment.
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides explaining the project, model architecture, training process, and application usage.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for detailed instructions on how to contribute and collaborate on the project.

## Next Steps

- Explore the codebase and documentation to understand the project's components.
- If available, review the datasets used for training and testing the model.
- Consider contributing if you're interested in collaborating with the team.

### Additional Considerations

- Address potential data privacy and ethical concerns if user data is involved.
- Provide clear instructions for app deployment, considering technical limitations in rural settings.
- Collaborate with healthcare professionals for user testing, validation, and possible integration into existing care pathways.
